Project Type: University

Duration: 6 weeks

Context:
This project involves a data-driven investigation into the Queensland Government Advance Queensland program, with the aim of examining how public funds have been distributed over time under the umbrella of this program. Given the political sensitivity around the allocation of public money, this analysis was conducted with awareness that the findings could support a positive narrative of success or, alternatively, raise concerns about possible irregularities or inequities. 

Task:
The analysis focuses on two key areas: (a) the geographical balance of funding between South-East Queensland and regional Queensland, and (b) whether the distribution of funds aligns with the programs stated objectives, such as new ideas, innovation and technology. By exploring patterns in the data, the goal is to provide evidence that may either validate the programs effectiveness or highlight areas that warrant further scrutiny.

Challenges:
A key challenge in this project was ensuring that the analysis remained fair, ethical, and contextually informed. It was important to avoid drawing simplistic conclusions such as assuming that all regions, groups, or activities should receive equal funding. In reality, disproportionate allocations may be justified due to factors such as higher operational costs, geographic needs, or efforts to address social disadvantage. Additionally, the benefits of funded initiatives vary in nature some deliver measurable economic outcomes, while others provide cultural or social value that is less easily quantified.

Process:
To investigate the distribution of funding under the Advance Queensland program, I followed a structured data analysis workflow:

Data Acquisition: I sourced publicly available data from the following URL https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/db190f2d-f866-4811-9a6e-4b78744b551b/resource/0f97b985-f5c7-49d2-8b0a-bc5dfbe070b9/download/advance-queensland-funding-recipients.csv in CSV format.

Data Preparation: I prepared the dataset by handling missing values, changing the data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I explored the data through data transformation, manipulation and aggregation techniques  and visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histogram and box plots, pie charts) to identify trends.

Ethical Interpretation: Throughout the analysis, I remained cautious not to misrepresent disproportionate funding as unfair without understanding the context recognizing that higher funding might reflect genuine needs or costs.

Visualization and Reporting: I used Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib/Plotly, Seaborn) libraries in jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization. I also summarized the visualizations in Power BI using measures and new columns to build visual reports, presenting the findings in a clear, accessible format.

Result:
The analysis confirmed a clear imbalance in the allocation of funds between South-East Queensland and regional Queensland. This disparity was illustrated through breakdowns by RAP Regions, funding programs, and types of recipients. However, further investigation showed that this distribution aligns with Advance Queensland core objective to foster innovation and drive economic growth across the state. This justification became evident when analyzing recipient details, program categories, and project titles, which suggested funding decisions were made to support innovation potential rather than geographical equity alone.

Additionally, the analysis revealed a decline in overall funding amounts allocated to both regions over time. Some possible contributing factors include:

1. Softening of project selection and monitoring criteria

2. Lenient background checks on recipients

3. Misalignment between project objectives and the capacity of the recipient organization
