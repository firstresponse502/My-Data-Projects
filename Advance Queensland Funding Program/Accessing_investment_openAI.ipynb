More than 76,000 incidents of cybercrime were reported in 2021-22.</p> <p>Albanese said he welcomed Microsoft’s collaboration with ASD because a strong economy required protection from cyber threats.</p> <p>The prime minister also characterised Microsoft’s commitments as “a major investment in the skills and workers of the future, which will help Australia to strengthen our position as a world-leading economy”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/08/australia-cybersecurity-laws-hacks-optus-medibank-privacy-data-breach\">Australians increasingly concerned about online privacy after high-profile cybersecurity breaches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Microsoft says the new investment in Australia will increase its computing capacity by around 250% over the next two years, enabling the company to meet growing demand for cloud computing services. It would also help Australia capitalise on “the significant economic and productivity opportunities presented by the latest AI technology”.</p> <p>The computing giant has committed to supporting an additional 300,000 Australians as part of its global skills programs and is “working towards” launching its first Datacentre Academy in Australia in early 2024, in partnership with Tafe NSW.</p> <p>The computing giant says the enhanced funding is the single largest investment in Australia during its 40-year presence in the country.</p> <p>Worrall said in a statement the proposed infrastructure, skilling and cybersecurity investments and initiatives would “build on our long-term commitment to Australia, but are squarely focused on the future”.</p> <p>“They will not only enable a safer and more secure digital economy, but also provide a platform to foster growth and innovation in the era of AI,” Worrall said.</p>'},\n",
